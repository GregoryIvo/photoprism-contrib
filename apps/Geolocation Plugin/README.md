## Geolocation Plugin

The Geolocation Plugin is an [open source extension](https://github.com/andyvalerio/photoprism-geolocation) that makes it easy to change latitude and longitude of a photo by selecting places on a graphical map. 
It can be installed through the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geolocation-plugin-for-ph/oggmpodnbdcmfiognbkkeffacpeaifch).

Thank you very much @andyvalerio ❤️
